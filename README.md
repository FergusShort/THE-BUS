# ðŸšŒ The Bus

## What is *The Bus*?
**The Bus** is a virtualized version of a popular drinking card game. The game challenges players to guess whether the next card will be higher or lower â€” simple, engaging, and now completely digital.

## Why Did I Build It?
One evening in my flat, we wanted to play a classic drinking card game â€” but realized we didnâ€™t have any physical cards. Instead of giving up, I decided to turn this into a fun opportunity: I built a web version of the game using **JavaScript** and **React**.

This was my **first personal JavaScript and React project**, and it kickstarted my journey into web development and interactive user interfaces.
